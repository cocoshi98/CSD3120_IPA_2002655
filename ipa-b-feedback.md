**IPA-B Grade**: C
                                        
## B1
complete 3D scene (with (a) a background environment or live video feed and (b) manipulable objects) and clear consistent theme
                                        
## B2
desktop-based grab and translate interaction exists but very buggy (or you only had additional, e.g. HMD, interaction but did not implement desktop-based)
                                        
## B3
desktop-based attach interaction exists but very buggy (or you only had additional, e.g. HMD, interaction but did not implement desktop-based)

rotate interaction doesn't work
                                        
## B5
"pinch" interaction doesn't work
                                        
## B6
both desktop and an additional form of locomotion interaction exist and works well
